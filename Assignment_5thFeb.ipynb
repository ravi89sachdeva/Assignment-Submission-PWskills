    "\n",
    "Ans- A class is a user defined layout or blueprint of an object that describes what a specific kind of object \n",
    "will look like. A class description consists of two things- one is attributes or member variables , other is \n",
    "implementation of behaviour or member functions. \n",
    "Example:- A mobile phone has attributes like brand name , RAM and functions like texting and calling. \n",
    "So, mobile phone is a class of various phones (the objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a single instance of class which contains data and methods working on that data.So an object\n",
    "consists of three things : name or variable name , member data that describes the object and member methods as \n",
    "behaviour of an object.\n",
    "Example-Samsung galaxy is an object with brand name Samsung , 2GB RAM as properties and texting as behaviours."

    "## What is inheritence . Give an example of each type of inheritence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Inheritence is a mechanism in which once class acquires the property of another class\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single inheritence- This is a form of inheritance in which a class inherits only one parent class.\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "  def f1(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Function of parent class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "  def f2(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Function of child class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "object1 = Child()\n",
    "object1.f1()\n",
    "object1.f2()\n",
    "Here the class Child is inheriting only one class Parent\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance-An inheritance becomes multiple inheritances when a class inherits more than one parent class\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "class Parent_1:\n",
    "  def f1(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Function of parent_1 class.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent_2:\n",

    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent_1, Parent_2, Parent_3):\n",

    "Here we have one Child class which is inheriting properties of three-parent classes Parent_1, Parent_2, and Parent_3. \n",
    "All the classes have different functions and all of the functions are called using the object of the Child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multi-level Inheritance\n",
    "For example, a class_1 is inherited by a class_2 and \n",
    "this class_2 also gets inherited by class_3 and this process goes on. This is known as multi-level inheritance\n",
